- test organize plain,
    recursively,
    recursively-flatten,
    archive(?),
    with/without 'hidden'

- add dir_diff as separate feature
    -> flags skip-nested-dirs (or recursive version)
    -> skip-hidden
    -> list of files to skip comparing -> supported by underlying dircmp?
    -> full list of file names
    -> short statistics -> numbers only per dir/subdir

- expand readme / add docs?
