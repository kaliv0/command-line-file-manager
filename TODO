- add dir_diff as separate feature
    -> list of files to skip comparing -> supported by underlying dircmp?

- if dir is "." -> display as pwd ?
- add functionality to provide external config for organizing dir names
- move all docstrings to short_help in @click.command()

- expand readme / add docs?
