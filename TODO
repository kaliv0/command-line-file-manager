- add dir_diff as separate feature
    -> list of files to skip comparing -> supported by underlying dircmp?

- if dir is "." -> display as pwd ?
- add functionality to provide external config for organizing dir names
- move all docstrings to short_help in @click.command()

- show short messages if both dirs in compare__ are identical

- fix search recursively -> if file/dir not found in root skips diving deeper
    -> also add option to search for files/dirs only


- expand readme / add docs? -> use clik-sphinx library
