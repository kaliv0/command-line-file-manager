- add dir_diff as separate feature
    -> list of files to skip comparing -> supported by underlying dircmp?

- if dir is "." -> display as pwd ? -> scan, show
- add functionality to provide external config for organizing dir names
- move all docstrings to short_help in @click.command()

- show short messages if both dirs in compare__ are identical

- expand readme / add docs? -> use clik-sphinx library
