- add dir_diff as separate feature
    -> list of files to skip comparing -> supported by underlying dircmp?
- add flag to scan (catalog) only files/dirs

- show short messages if both dirs in compare__ are identical
- show warning msg /error? if diff between same dir
- similarly -> of there are no duplicates in dir (recursively)

- add functionality to provide external config for organizing dir names
