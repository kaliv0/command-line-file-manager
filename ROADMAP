- expand archive options/formats

- fm tidy -> prompt user interactively according to found file types/extensions

- fix organize
    -> plain version
        -> if dir contains no files to be moved (e.g. only subdirs) -> exits without a message
    -> recursively
        -> without --flat moves dir inside newly created dir with same name (e.g. books -> books/books)
        -> with --flat moves files to same dir (e.g. from books to books)
